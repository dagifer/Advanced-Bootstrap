<h1 class="mb-3">About Me </h1>
<p>
I'm Dayana Daviott, a nature-loving adventurer with a passion for yoga, climbing, and hiking in the mountains. The great outdoors is where I find my bliss, pushing my limits and immersing myself in the beauty of nature. Fluent in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, I have a knack for connecting with people from diverse backgrounds and bridging cultural gaps. This multilingual ability allows me to forge meaningful connections and embrace the richness of different cultures.
</p>
</br>
<p>Although I graduated in Tourism Business Administration, my real passion lies in web development. I have chosen to pursue a career in web development at SheCodes.com. This decision reflects my thirst for knowledge and personal growth. By combining my expertise in the tourism industry with my programming skills, I aim to create innovative solutions that enhance user experiences and push the boundaries of what's possible.
</p>
</br>
<p>In summary, I'm an adventurous spirit who finds joy in the great outdoors and has chosen web development as a path to combine my passions and create meaningful change. With a deep appreciation for nature, a multicultural perspective, and a love for coding, I'm excited to embark on a journey of exploration and growth in the world of web development.
